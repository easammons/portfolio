                <div class="panel">
                    <p>One large comet this year is comet 12p, also known as the devil comet. It comes around the earth every 71 years. It gets it's name from the time it had an outburst, giving it an appearance of having horns. It can be seen with binoculars or a small telescope. Perehilion: April 21, 2024</p>
                    <p>Fun Fact: Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is notable for being the parent comet of the annual meteor shower known as the December Phoenicids. These meteors are associated with Comet 12P and occur around December 6-9 each year. The comet itself was discovered independently by astronomers Jean-Louis Pons and William Robert Brooks in 1812 and 1883, respectively. It has a relatively short orbital period of about 71 years, and its association with a meteor shower adds to its astronomical interest.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                <p>Perehilion: June 30, 2024</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Comet 13P/Olbers is named after the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who discovered it in 1815. Olbers is also known for his Olbers' paradox, which questions why the night sky is dark if the universe is infinitely large and populated with an infinite number of stars. Comet 13P/Olbers is a periodic comet that orbits the Sun every 69.4 years and has been observed during multiple returns since its discovery.</p>

                <button class="accordion">C/2023 A3 (Majewski)</button>
                <div class="panel">
                <p>Perehilion: September 27, 2024</p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Comet C/2023 A3 (Majewski) is named after its discoverer, Dr. Matthew J. Majewski, who identified it on January 13, 2023, using the Mount Lemmon Survey in Arizona. It is one of the several comets discovered by Dr. Majewski and is notable for its trajectory and potential brightness as it approaches the Sun.</p>

                <button class="accordion">333P/LINEAR</button>
                <div class="panel">
                <p>Perehilion: November 29, 2024 </p>
                <p>Fun Fact: Comet 333P/LINEAR is notable for being a "triple comet." It consists of a main comet nucleus and two smaller fragments that orbit around it. This triple structure was discovered using radar observations by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in 2016. Triple comets are relatively rare and studying them provides insights into the dynamics and formation processes of cometary nuclei.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Comet Leonard (C/2021 A1)</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Discovered in January 2021, Comet Leonard is expected to be visible in late 2023 and early 2024. It will be closest to Earth in late December 2023.</p>
                    <p>Fun Fact: Comet Leonard was discovered by astronomer Gregory J. Leonard using the Mount Lemmon Survey in Arizona. It is his third comet discovery.

                <button class="accordion">Comet C/2023 A1 (Lemmon)</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Discovered in January 2023, Comet Lemmon is predicted to be visible in the latter half of 2024. It may become visible to the naked eye depending on its brightness.</p>
                    <p>Fun Fact: Comet Lemmon is named after the Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona, where it was discovered. This observatory is known for its contributions to the discovery of many comets and asteroids.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Comet P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS)</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>This periodic comet will be making its closest approach to Earth in 2024. Although it's not expected to be very bright, it might be observable with telescopes.</p>
                    <p>Fun Fact: This comet was discovered by the Pan-STARRS survey, which stands for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System. It is designed to detect near-Earth objects as well as other celestial bodies.

                    <p>This comet, famous for being the target of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, will make a close approach to Earth in 2024. It will likely require a telescope to observe.</p>
                    <p>Fun Fact: Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was the destination of the Rosetta spacecraft, launched by the European Space Agency. Rosetta studied the comet up close and even deployed a lander called Philae to its surface in November 2014, providing unprecedented data and images of a comet nucleus.</p>

        <section class="Title">
            <h1>Upcoming Meteor Showers</h1>
            <p>For all meteor showers, the key is to find a location away from bright city lights. National parks, state parks, and designated dark sky areas often provide excellent viewing conditions. Additionally, checking the weather forecast for clear skies and planning to view during the peak hours (typically after midnight when the radiant point is high in the sky) will maximize your chances of seeing more meteors.</p>

                <img class="acc-img" src="images/comet-3b.jpg" alt="photo of a comet">
            <section class="list1">
                <button class="accordion">Perseids </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Best Viewing: The Perseids are best seen from locations with minimal light pollution. Look for dark sky areas away from city lights. National parks, remote rural areas, or designated dark sky preserves are excellent choices. (Peak: August 11-13)</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Orionids </button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Best Viewing: Similar to the Perseids, the Orionids are best observed away from city lights. Find a dark location with a clear view of the eastern sky after midnight. Ideally, choose a spot with an open view to the horizon. (Peak: October 21-22)</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Leonids</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Best Viewing: The Leonids can be observed from anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere. Look towards the constellation Leo in the eastern sky after midnight. Again, dark sky locations away from urban light pollution are ideal. (Peak: November 17-18)</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Geminids</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Best Viewing: The Geminids are one of the best meteor showers of the year. They can be seen from almost anywhere around the globe. Look towards the constellation Gemini in the northeastern sky after midnight. Dark sky locations will provide the best viewing experience. (Peak: December 13-14)</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Quadrantids</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Best Viewing: The Quadrantids have a short peak window, and they are best viewed from dark sky locations. Look towards the northern sky after midnight, specifically towards the constellation Bootes. Areas with minimal light pollution will enhance visibility. (Peak: January 3-4)</p>
