                <h1>What Causes The Northern Lights?</h1>
                <p>The northern lights are a beautiful display of streaks of light that dance across the sky. But what causes them? The sun often emits charged particles, and sometimes due to major solar events -known as Solar Particle Events (SPEs) or solar radiation storms - these particles hit earth. These dangerous particles then get caught in the magnetic field of the earth, and are pulled toward the poles where they interact with the gases in our atmosphere and heat them up, causing them to glow. Excited oxyen atoms glow red and green (depending on altitude), and that is why northern lights look the way they look!</p>

                <h1>What Causes Meteor Showers?</h1>
                <p>Believed to be a sign of good fortune, or even something to wish on, these bright streaks across the sky grace us with their presence every now and then, but why? Despite their othre name as falling stars, this phenonmenon can be blamed on dust and debris left behind by comets, asteroids and other bodies (an sometimes, even ones outside our solar system) which enter the earth's atmosphere at high speeds. As these dust particles enter the atmosphere, they collide and rub together with air particles, causing them to heat up, catch flame and disintegrate. These flaming objects then light up the sky, and we can be dazzled by their firey demise.

                <h1>Current Brightest Objects In The Night Sky</h1>
                <p>Of course, the brightest object in our sky is the sun, followed by the moon being the brightest object in our sky, but what else? Without the sun painting our atmosphere an opaque blue, the brightest objects we can see are Venus, closely followed by Jupiter. </p>
                <p>Venus is the sister planet of Earth, right next to us and similar in size. Venus is closer to the sun than the earth is, so it is found close to the sun. So you can find it just above the horizon right before sunrise and just after sunset. It is the first object in the night sky to be seen after sunset, and is the last to leave before sunrise, which is why it is dubbed “The Evening Star” even though it is not a star. Followed by Venus, the next brightest object is Jupiter. Jupiter can aslo be seen in Twilight with the naked eye, and moves roughly 30 degrees each year across the belt of zodiac constellations. The best time to see this gas giant is when it is in opposition, which is when it is on the opposite side of the earth than the sun- this is also when it is closest to the earth. </p>
                <p>After these two planets, they are followed in brightness by Sirius, the brightest star in the nigt sky, residing in the constellation Canis Major. It is also known as the Dog Star, or Canicula. It is only 8.6 lightyears away, and shines with a luminosty more than 20 times that of the sun. In the northern hemisphere, you can see it in the evening skies in late winter.
